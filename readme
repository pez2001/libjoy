to compile it you need to have cmake on your system.
(one object + no deps = shouldnt be too hard to compile
 if you dont have cmake or don't want to install it)


Tested and written under Linux(debian based system).

You can take a look at: 
http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/input/joystick-api.txt
to get an idea what this library does,which friendly spoken is not much.

or at:
libjoytest.c
to see how to access the library functions and get a quick start.

Notes on joytool:
If you choose to get the values without the wait/wait_for_complete option 
you should never set the timeout value to values under 20 ms,
inconsistencies may appear if you do depending on your configuration.
